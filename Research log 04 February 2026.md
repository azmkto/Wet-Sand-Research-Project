# Wet-Sand-Research-Project

Research log 04 February 2026

I only continue read Mitara & Nori (2005) about Wet Granular Material. 
1. There are many notable information that really helpful to build an argument, such as hysteresis that occur during drying process is stronger than in wetting process
2. In spherical beads, if the liquid content < critical value, most of the liquid is trapped on the particle surface. If the liquid content > critical value liquid bridges are formed at the contact point. 

Those two concepts will fill the gap of my research and able to give more comprehension to the result, such as Why there are some samples shared the similar color and brigthness level. Furthermore, it could be the explanation why there is minus mass after the drying process is done.

Need further investigation through it. For next read, I will focus on example of things that used color as its proxy.
